            <h1>Local Food in Surabaya</h1>
            <h3>Rawon Surabaya</h3>
            <p>One of the delicious local foods in Surabaya, Indonesia is "Rawon." Rawon is a flavorful and aromatic
                black beef soup that is not only a culinary delight but also a cultural symbol of the city. This dish is
                known for its rich, dark color, which is achieved by using a special blend of ingredients, including
                keluak nuts, which give it its distinctive black hue.
                <br><br>
                Rawon is typically served with steamed rice, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and a sambal (spicy chili paste)
                on the side. It's customary to squeeze fresh lime juice into the soup to enhance its tangy flavor. The
                combination of the tender beef, aromatic broth, and the bold flavors of the spices make Rawon a beloved
                and iconic dish in Surabaya, enjoyed by locals and visitors alike.
